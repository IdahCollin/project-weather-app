# Weather App

Week 4 of Technigo boot camp. Three of us were working in a team/with pair programming. The assignment was to  build a simple weather app that tells today's weather and temperature and a 5-day forecast using a weather API.

## The problem

The team was new to working with branches, fetching data from API, how to use promises and working with the Date() object in JavaScript. Clear communication, course material, stack overflow and chatGPT was used to approach problems. We set up a feature freeze which we had to change due to some bugs. 

With more time we would do some more styling warm/cold, add geolocation and GIFs.
