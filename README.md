# Weather App

Week 4 of Technigo boot camp. Three of us were working in a team/with pair programming. The assignment was to  build a simple weather app that tells today's weather and temperature and a 5-day forecast using a weather API.


## The problem

Clear communication, course material, stack overflow and chatGPT was used to approach problems. We set up a feature freeze which we had to change due to some bugs. 

With more time we would do some styling warm/cold, add geolocation and GIFs.
